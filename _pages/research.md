My research focuses on moduli spaces and their geometry. This means that I am interested in constructing them, compactifying them and in computing some of their invariants (e.g. Chow groups, unramified cohomology, Brauer groups).

The kind of techniques that I use include stack-theoretical methods, logarithmic geometry, equivariant intersection theory and Galois cohomology. In my darkest times, I also use Mathematica for doing explicit computations involving localization formulas.

## Research interests

- Moduli of curves, quasi-polarized K3 surfaces, Weierstrass fibrations, stable maps.
- Picard groups, integral Chow rings, equivariant intersection theory.
- Cohomological invariants (a.k.a. unramified cohomology) and Brauer groups.
- Quadratic intersection theory and Chow-Witt groups.
- Logarithmic geometry, compactification of Prym varieties.
