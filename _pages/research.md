My research focuses on moduli spaces and their invariants, like integral Picard groups, integral Chow(-Witt) rings, Brauer groups as well as more arithmetically-oriented cohomological invariants (a.k.a. unramified cohomology); most of my work so far consisted in explicitly compute (some of) these invariants for moduli of hyperelliptic curves, moduli of smooth/stable curves of low genus and moduli of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces of low degree.

The kind of techniques that I use range from the more abstract stack-theoretical methods to the more down-to-earth equivariant intersection theory. In my darkest times, I also use Mathematica for doing explicit computations involving localization formulas.

## Research interests

- Moduli spaces/stacks of curves and of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces.
- Picard groups and integral Chow rings.
- Equivariant intersection theory.
- Cohomological invariants (a.k.a. unramified cohomology) of moduli stacks.
- Brauer groups.
- Chow-Witt groups.
