Currently, I am a tenure-track assistant professor (RtdB) at the [University of Pisa](https://www.dm.unipi.it/).

Before this, I spent three years as a wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter (basically a postdoc) at [Humboldt University](https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/en) in Berlin, working in the group of [Gavril Farkas](https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~farkas/). 

Before that, I spent a year and a half as a postdoc at [Aarhus University](https://math.au.dk/en/) with [Gergely Berczi](https://sites.google.com/view/gergely-berczi/home).

I did my graduate studies at [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en) in Pisa, under the wise guidance of [Angelo Vistoli](http://homepage.sns.it/vistoli/).

I got both my bachelor and my master degree from the [University of Rome "La Sapienza"](https://www.mat.uniroma1.it/en).

You can find my full CV [here](CV25.pdf) (last updated June 2025).
