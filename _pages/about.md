Currently, I am a postdoc at [Aarhus University](https://qgm.au.dk).

I did my graduate studies at [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en) in Pisa, under the wise guidance of [Angelo Vistoli](http://homepage.sns.it/vistoli/).

I got both my bachelor and my master degree from the [University of Rome "La Sapienza"](https://www.mat.uniroma1.it/en).

You can find my full CV [here](CV_DiLorenzo.pdf).
